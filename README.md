## 🧩 How It Works

The program asks the user for:
- A few **nouns**
- Some **verbs**
- An **adjective**

Then it automatically builds a personalized story using those words.

Example:
```
👉 Enter a noun: dog  
👉 Enter an adjective: funny  
👉 Enter a verb: dance  
👉 Enter another noun: teacher  
👉 Enter another verb: run
```

Output:
```
🌟 Once upon a time, there was a funny dog who loved to dance all day.

One day, teacher walked into the room and caught the dog in the act.

teacher: "What are you doing?"
dog: "I'm just dancing, what's the big deal?"
teacher: "Well, it's not every day that you see a dog dancing in the middle of the day."
dog: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."
teacher: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go run instead?"
dog: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

🎉 And so, teacher and the dog went off to run and had a great time.
The end.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `input()` for user interaction  
- `def` to create reusable functions  
- `while` loop for input validation  
- `f-strings` for formatted strings  
- Multi-line strings (`""" """`)
